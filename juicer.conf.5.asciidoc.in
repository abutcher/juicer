NAME
----
juicer.conf - juicer configuration file

SYNOPSIS
--------
juicer configuration file

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Sections and variables to use in your juicer configuration file. This
file is broken into two or more parts. The first is *DEFAULT* and the
rest are named after your environments, e.g., *qa*, *stage*, or
*prod*.

Assuming you have a *devel* and *prod* environment, you might have a
configuration file that looks like this:

[literal]
    # ~/.config/juicer/config - In this example config file we maintain two
    # environments: devel and prod.

    [DEFAULT]
    username: tux
    password: 5w33tP@ssw04d
    port: 443
    verify_ssl: True
    ca_path: /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

    # 'devel' is the base environment. This means juicer will default
    # to using 'devel' first when commands are not specified with an
    # explicit environment(s).
    start_in: devel

    # Carts are stored in a mongodb instance somewhere. This is the
    # hostname of our mongodb server. A replica set can be specified by
    # comma delimiting hostname and port combinations.
    cart_seeds: mongodb01.util.tux.org:27017,mongodb02.util.tux.org:27017

    [devel]
    # Most of our configuration for this environment lives in the
    # DEFAULT section already, but we do need to tell Juicer where
    # this environment promotes to next.
    promotes_to: prod

    # Our hosts will probably differ per environment and will thus
    # have a different certificate.
    hostname: devel.util.tux.org
    cert_filename: /etc/pki/pulp/devel.crt

    [prod]
    # Our hosts will probably differ per environment and will thus
    # have a different certificate.
    hostname: prod.util.tux.org
    cert_filename: /etc/pki/pulp/prod.crt
